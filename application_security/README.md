# Week 13 - Application Security
In this, the last session of Hack Night. We will be going over Fuzzing and later have a short discussion on what you can do to continue improving your skills. Fuzzing is a black box software testing technique, which consists of finding implementation bugs by manipulating input data sent to an application automatically. We will go over different types of fuzzing, various methods used for fuzzing, and finally the process of "smart" fuzzing.
