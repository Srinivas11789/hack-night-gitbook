# Week 8 - Reverse Engineering \\\\ Part 3
In this session we will cover [Introductory Intel x86: Architecture, Assembly, Applications, and Alliteration by Xeno Kovah](http://www.opensecuritytraining.info/IntroX86.html) from [OpenSecurityTraining](http://www.opensecuritytraining.info/Welcome.html). Intel processors have been a major force in personal computing for more than 30 years. An understanding of low level computing mechanisms used in Intel chips as taught in this course serves as a foundation upon which to better understand other hardware, as well as many technical specialties such as reverse engineering, compiler design, operating system design, code optimization, and vulnerability exploitation. 50% of the time will be spent learning Windows/Linux tools and analysis of "simple" programs.
