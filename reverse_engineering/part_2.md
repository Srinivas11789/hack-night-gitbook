# Week 7 - Reverse Engineering \\\\ Part 2
Picking up from previous session, we will watch the last video on Reverse Engineering, and present you with an application which has no source code. Your job is to understand what the application is doing and figure out any loopholes present in that application. You'll use static analysis tools like IDA and varied dynamic analysis to analyze the binary and get a complete understanding of the application.
