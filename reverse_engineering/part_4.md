# Week 9 - Reverse Engineering \\\\ Part 4
Picking up from the last week's session, we will continue to explore the world of x86. This is going to be a workshop were we will write programs at assembly level. Once, we get familiar to basic x86 instructions we will switch to analyzing a real application and try to get high level understanding of what the application is doing. The goal would be to get familiar with calling conventions, stack and stack frames.
