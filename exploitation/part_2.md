# Week 11 - Exploitation \\\\ Part 2
Picking up from the last session, we will finish watching Dino Dai Zovi's lecture and do a live exploitation of a vulnerable program. We will go through all the steps that Dino explained in his lecture to write a control flow hijacking exploit and take over the program. Once we are done with 1990's style exploitation, we will re-compile the program with modern mitigation technologies and look at various techniques used to bypass these mitigation's.
